# Health Questions and Answers Platform (2020)

## Description
Hablaqui-Q&A is a dynamic platform designed for health-related questions and answers. Users have the ability to confidentially consult healthcare professionals on a wide range of topics.

This project was developed during my fourth semester of Commercial Engineering, while simultaneously participating in Startup School, a graduation pathway focused on entrepreneurship and innovation at the School of Engineering at the Adolfo Ibáñez University.
